## Description

Token Grabber created in NodeJS with features of a very powerful thief, this Token Grabber works by simply adding a discord webhook with which it will already send all the discord tokens and other data like local IP, username , ram information, etc...

This README provides a brief overview of what a token grabber is, its potential uses, and some ethical and legal considerations. 📄

## How Token Grabbers Work

Token grabbers work by intercepting and capturing tokens as they are transmitted between a client and a server. This interception can occur through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, man-in-the-middle attacks, or through malicious software or scripts injected into a user's device. 📂
